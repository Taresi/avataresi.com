        <h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>I transform technical products into technical documents!</h2>
		<p>My name is Ava Taresi, and I am a technical communicator and a student of Technical Communications at Seneca College. As a technical communicator, I am academically trained to use usability, findability, and accessibility as the core elements of documentations and content creation.</p>
		<p>I graduated from college having majored in technical communication. From my BA in journalism, I learned how to write, analyze, collaborate, communicate, and solve problems. My diverse educational background strengthened my interdisciplinary skills.</p>	
        <p>To make most of those elements, I analyze my both the subject product and end users of the product to create interactive content, be a user guide, whitepaper, or an instructional product.</p>
		<p>My work reflects how committed I am to user-centered design methods to provide maximum usability for the users. I have written in a variety of sectors, from financial to software and commerce.</p>
        <p>	I’m always looking for new opportunities and projects. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working together.</p>
